## Lab 1 – Titanic Data Analysis (`lab1_titanic_diaz.ipynb`)

- Loaded Titanic passenger data (CSV).
- Cleaned and pre-processed data (handling missing values).
- Explored distributions of features like age, sex, passenger class.
- Performed basic statistical analysis (mean, median, mode).
- Visualized survival rates by categories (e.g., class, sex) using plots.

---

## Lab 2 – Titanic Survival Modeling (`lab2_titanic_diaz.ipynb`)

- Created new variables, encoded categorical features for modeling.
- Built simple machine learning classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).
- Evaluated model performance with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix.
- Generated and interpreted plots of model performance.

## Lab 3 – Introduction to Sympy (`lab3_sympy_diaz.ipynb`)

- Introduced `sympy` for symbolic computation in Python.
- Defined symbols and symbolic expressions (e.g., polynomials).
- Conducted algebraic operations: simplification, expansion, factoring.
- Computed derivatives and integrals symbolically.
- Solved basic algebraic and calculus equations.
- Visualized functions via `matplotlib`.

---

## Lab 4 – Advanced Sympy Applications (`lab4_sympy_diaz.ipynb`)

- Continued exploring advanced features of `sympy`.
- Solved systems of symbolic equations.
- Performed limits, series expansions, and more complex integrations/differentiations.
- Generated symbolic matrices and calculated determinants/inverses.
- Reinforced understanding of symbolic manipulation and theoretical math via computation.
